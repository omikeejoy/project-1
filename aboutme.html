               <h1>Quick Facts About Me</h1>
               <ol>
                <li>I studied medicine for 6 years at Cambridge University, graduating in 2018.</li>
                <li>I spent 2 years working as a Junior Doctor in the UKs National Health Service.</li>
                <li>I started my YouTube channel in 2017. </li>
                <li>My first videos were about medicine and studying. Now I make content about <br>productivity,
                books, tech, and evidence-based strategies and tools to help us <br>be more productive and build a life we love.</li> 
               <li>I'm 29 years old. Born in May, 1994 in Pakistan. I now live in London.</li>
               </ol>

            <h1>My Journey from Student to Creator</h1>
              <p>My YouTube journey started back in 2017 when I was still a student at Cambridge University. I <br>was studying to become a doctor (the dream was to specialise in plastic surgery). Back then, I <br>started creating videos to help other people with studying and passing exams. This is when I <br>started my first business with my brother, 6Med. We created a platform to help people pass the <br>entrance exams and get into medicine.</p>
              <p>Fast forward a few years and the videos I was creating started to be geared more towards <br>productivity and passing on the knowledge that got me through medical school. I'd spend every <br>spare minute I had planning the next video, writing scripts or researching ideas.</p>
              <br>

              <br>
              <div class="timeline">
              <p>By 2020 I'd hired a small team to help me run the channel. With their help, I was bashing out a <br>couple of videos a week whilst working as a junior doctor. That's when the idea of our Part Time <br>YouTuber Academy came to me. I figured all the knowledge I’d gained on this journey would be <br>helpful to at least 10 people, so we launched Cohort 1 of PTYA in November of 2020. Over 350 <br>people joined lol.</p>
